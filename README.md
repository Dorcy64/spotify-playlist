# spotify-playlist

This is a spotify playlist maker based on the year you insert.

HOW IT WORKS:

1) To make it work just head to developer (dot) spotify (dot) com get your api keys and set the redirect url to http://example.com
2) Replace the os.environ.get with your API Keys respectively or just sent the keys to your environment variables.
3) Run it, accept the use of the api in the browser and a brand new playlist will be created with the time you insert. 
4) Enjoy travelling through time with the music.
